## Can we ...

* display calendar-related activities: time of day, day of week, day of year, and etc simultaneously?
* visualise such looooong historical temporal data on a limited screen space?
* look up the date when there's interesting pattern going on without interactivity?

## YES, WE CAN.

???

* How to effectively plot long historical series
* Simultaneously showing the time of the day, day of the week, day of the year effect
* Without looking up the whole data table or using interactive graphics, how
  would we know when it happened?
